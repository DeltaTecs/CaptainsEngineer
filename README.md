The CaptainsEngineer is a Twitch Chat Bot designed to assist and enrich the live streaming experience. Originaly designed for "CaptainCasimir"'s channel, it is configurable to be deployed on any channel and provides a maritim context ;)


# Setup
The bot requires NodeJS and is designed to work solely on Windows.

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS (tested on v16.13.1)
- local VLC installation (later to be copied into the bot directory)
- Windows

## Getting the source
1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm i -d` to install node dependencies
3. Install VLC Mediaplayer and make a copy of its main directory to be called 'vlc' with its main content. The Bot will later access vlc.exe to play sounds

## Configuring
1. in the `bot.js` set `DISCORD_INVITE` to a Discord perma invite link of your choice and `REDDIT_LINK` to a Reddit link of your choice
2. access privilaged users can be set with `PRIV_STREAMER`, `PRIV_SUPPORT`, `PRIV_MOD_0` and `PRIV_MOD_1`
3. set your channel name in the `credentials.json`
4. update and start the bot by runing `update.bat`, it will download the latest version from the repo and connect to your specified channel
5. optional: embed your own sounds by replacing .mp3 files or changine the source names in the `bot.js`
6. optional: set up channel rewards to play sounds or trigger a random challenge to be displayed using the `REWARD_ID_...` variables.


# Usage: As a viewer

The bot will manage a currency called the Captain's Coin. A viewer will recieve a coin for each (non command) chat message he sends. The amount is adjustable later.
With this currency the viewer can engage in a variety of activities. They can play sounds, trigger events such as text to speech and play with a slot machine.
Any new viewer will also get a welcome message and a sound played by the bot.
